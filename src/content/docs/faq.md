## What is Keychain?

## What kind of information is shown on my profile?

The initial details displayed alongside your picture include your reputation score, display name, and description. Below that, you can find information about your followers, the accounts you are following, and your registration date on Ecency. In the Ecency settings, you can choose to add additional details such as your bio, profile picture, cover image, and location.

## What can I do if my HIVE or Hive dollar tokens are stolen or sent to the wrong account?

If your liquid tokens are stolen or sent to the wrong account, there is no action you can take. However, if your tokens are in Hive Power, the chances of being hacked are less than 1/13 per week. Additionally, if your tokens are in savings, there is a three-day waiting period before they can be transferred. It may be safer to stake/power up or transfer funds into savings.

## What are the dollar amounts next to posts and comments?

The estimated dollar amounts displayed next to posts and comments represent the potential payout that will be received at the end of the payout period. This estimate is based on the current voting activity and price of HIVE. The actual payout may fluctuate until the period ends. Payouts are a combination of Hive Power and Hive Dollars, although in certain cases, HIVE may be used instead of Hive Dollars depending on market conditions.
