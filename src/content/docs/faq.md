## What can I do if my HIVE or Hive dollar tokens are stolen or sent to the wrong account?

If your liquid tokens are stolen or sent to the wrong account, there is no action you can take. However, if your tokens are in Hive Power, the chances of being hacked are less than 1/13 per week. Additionally, if your tokens are in savings, there is a three-day waiting period before they can be transferred. It may be safer to stake/power up or transfer funds into savings.

## What are the dollar amounts next to posts and comments?

The estimated dollar amounts displayed next to posts and comments represent the potential payout that will be received at the end of the payout period. This estimate is based on the current voting activity and price of HIVE. The actual payout may fluctuate until the period ends. Payouts are a combination of Hive Power and Hive Dollars, although in certain cases, HIVE may be used instead of Hive Dollars depending on market conditions.

## How DHF works?

Anyone can create a proposal and convince community to vote on their proposal to get funded. Before creating proposal, normal post should be published on blockchain and it is recommended to gather feedback before creating proposal. Proposal creation has fee of 10 HBD + 1 HBD for each day it lasts over 60 days.

Once proposal reaches certain threshold of tallied votes, it will start receiving funds each hour. If proposal falls below threshold, system will halt funding for that proposal. You can vote as many proposals as you want, there are no limits. Proposal cannot be edited, but can be deleted/withdrawn by creator.

## How to vote proposals?

Go to the Proposals Page there you can see all Proposals that can be voted on. You can click on them to see further information about the proposal before voting or you can click on the voting icon near the proposal without opening.
