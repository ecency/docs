[Hivesigner.com](https://hivesigner.com) is a secure authentication (OAuth2) service co-developed and maintained by Ecency.
It lets you sign in to Hive applications and approve transactions without exposing your private keys.
Applications built on Hive can integrate Hivesigner to handle user authentication without requesting or storing their credentials directly.
When you registered on Hive, you were provided with numerous keys that are difficult to recall.
Hivesigner allows you to create a memorable password and avoid using your active key when logging into Hive platforms.
Hivesigner supports posting, voting, transfers, and other common operations while keeping your credentials safe.
Because it isolates apps from your private keys, Hivesigner is one of the most secure ways to log in and sign transactions across the Hive ecosystem.
See the [Hivesigner documentation](https://docs.hivesigner.com) for integration guides and API references.
