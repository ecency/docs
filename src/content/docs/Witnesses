## What are Hive witnesses?

The witnesses or block producers in the Hive blockchain have the responsibility of serving as the governing body of the network. The top 20 witnesses continuously produce blocks every minute, while the remaining witnesses act as backup and have a randomized chance of producing blocks. These witnesses are elected by the community to represent their interests, and each user has the ability to vote for up to 30 witnesses. This role is crucial to the consensus mechanism of the blockchain, and it is recommended for users to actively engage in voting for trusted witnesses. In return for their block production, witnesses are rewarded with Hive Power.
