# Hive Accounts

A Hive account is your identity on the Hive blockchain. It‚Äôs used to post content, vote, comment, transfer funds, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps).

## Account Structure

Unlike traditional blockchains, Hive accounts have **human-readable usernames**, e.g., `alice`, `bob123`.

Each account has:

- A **unique name**
- A set of **private/public keys**
- A **reputation score**
- Resource credits (RC) to perform actions on the blockchain

---

## Hive Keys and Permissions

Every Hive account has **four distinct keys** with different roles:

| Key       | Use Case                         | Importance |
|-----------|----------------------------------|------------|
| **Owner** | Recovery, change other keys      | üîí Highest |
| **Active**| Financial transactions           | üí∞ Medium  |
| **Posting**| Voting, commenting, posting     | ‚úçÔ∏è Daily use |
| **Memo**  | Encrypt/decrypt memos in transfers | üîê Optional |

> üõ°Ô∏è Keep your **owner key** extremely safe and offline. Use **posting key** for everyday tasks.

## How to Create a Hive Account

There are several ways to create a Hive account:

- [Ecency Account Creation](https://ecency.com/signup)
- [HiveOnBoard](https://hiveonboard.com/)
- Purchase from other Hive users
- Through invited services or DApps

Most services offer **free signups** with social verifications or optional paid accounts for faster access.

## Managing Hive Keys

You can access your Hive account using:

- [Hive Keychain](https://hive-keychain.com) ‚Äì Browser extension and mobile app
- [HiveSigner](https://hivesigner.com) ‚Äì Web-based key authorization
- Manual key import ‚Äì used in Ecency apps or wallets

Always **back up your keys** and avoid storing them in unsecured places.

---

## Resource Credits (RC)

Hive uses a system called **Resource Credits** to avoid transaction fees. Every account has an RC balance based on their Hive Power.

Actions like posting, voting, and transferring use small amounts of RC. If you run out, you must wait for RC to regenerate or receive a delegation.

## Summary

- Hive accounts are **user-friendly, key-based identities**.
- They are required to post, vote, and interact on Hive.
- Use the right key for the right purpose.
- Protect your keys and keep the owner key offline.
