# Governance participation guide

Hive is community-governed. Your **Hive Power (HP)** determines how much influence you have over witnesses (block producers) and Decentralized Hive Fund (DHF) proposals. This guide shows how to participate through Ecency.

## Witness voting

Witnesses produce blocks and keep the network running.

1. Go to the [Witnesses page](https://ecency.com/witnesses).
2. Search or scroll to a witness and click the **vote** icon.
3. You can vote for up to **30 witnesses**; votes are weighted by your **HP**.
4. Reorder votes anytime — changes apply immediately.

### Tips

- Aim to vote for reliable, well-supported witnesses who communicate regularly.
- Keep at least a few backup witnesses selected in case top nodes go offline.
- Powering up increases the strength of your witness votes.

## DHF proposal voting

The **Decentralized Hive Fund (DHF)** finances community initiatives.

1. Visit the [Proposals page](https://ecency.com/proposals).
2. Review proposal details, milestones, and requested budgets.
3. Click the **thumbs-up** icon to approve or click again to withdraw your approval.
4. A proposal starts receiving payouts once **net approval** exceeds the funding threshold set by the top 20 witnesses.

### Tips

- Vote based on delivery history, transparency, and alignment with Hive's long-term health.
- Revisit votes periodically; withdrawing approval stops future payouts.
- HP affects proposal vote weight just like witness votes.

## Track your governance impact

- Check your **witness list** and **proposal votes** from your profile on Ecency.
- Follow governance discussions in community posts and in the [Ecency Help chat](https://ecency.com/chats/hive-125126/channel).
- Consider **powering up** to increase your influence over both witnesses and proposals.
