# Communities on Hive

Hive Communities are topic, journal and council based groups where users can publish content, connect, and moderate discussions. Communities create smaller ecosystems within Hive tailored to specific interests like photography, crypto, fitness, or parenting.

---

## Why Use Communities?

- Targeted audience for your content
- Custom rules and moderation
- Better content discovery
- Build niche-focused followings

> Communities are optional, but highly recommended for finding your tribe.

## Types of Communities

All communities and posts are viewable and readable by all, and there is a governance mechanism which can affect visibility and prioritization of content for the purpose of decreasing noise and increasing positive interactions (however a community wishes to define it) and discourse. 
By default, communities are open for all to post and comment ("topics"). However, an organization may create a restricted community ("journal") for official updates: only members of the organization would be able to post updates, but anyone can comment. Alternatively, a professional group or local community ("council") may choose to limit all posting and commenting to approved members (perhaps those they verify independently).

- üåç Topic: anyone can post or comment
- üì∞ Journal: guests can comment but not post. only members can post.
- üóûÔ∏è Council: only members can post or comment
