# Resource Credits (RC) on Hive

Hive uses a **Resource Credit (RC)** system to allow **feeless** transactions while still preventing spam.

Each account has a **regenerating RC pool** that determines how many operations it can perform on the blockchain (e.g., posting, voting, transferring).

---

## Why RC Matters

Without fees, Hive relies on RC to:
- Prevent abuse of network resources
- Ensure fair usage based on stake (Hive Power)
- Enable free access for genuine users

---

## How RC Works

- RC is **not a token**. Itâ€™s an internal value tied to your account.
- The more **Hive Power (HP)** you have, the more RC you get.
- RC regenerates over time (roughly 20% per day).
- Each action (e.g., post, comment, vote) costs a small amount of RC.

---

## Viewing Your RC

You can check your RC using:

- [Ecency](https://ecency.com/@yourname)
- [HiveHub.dev](https://hivehub.dev)
- Keychain Extension (RC info in wallet view)

---

## Running Out of RC

If you run out of RC:
- You **canâ€™t** perform new actions until RC regenerates.
- You can receive **HP delegation** [from Ecency](/ecency/boost-and-promote) or another user to temporarily increase your RC pool.

> ðŸ§  RC = bandwidth. No RC, no posting/voting until it recharges.

---

## How to Increase RC

To increase your RC:
- **Power up more HIVE** to gain Hive Power
- **Receive HP delegation** from another account
- Avoid unnecessary operations to let RC recharge

---

## Delegation for New Users

New accounts with little or no Hive Power often receive a small HP delegation to get started. Without this, they may be unable to post or vote.

Ecency and other apps sometimes help by providing **temporary HP** to new users for a smooth onboarding.

---

## Summary

- RC is Hiveâ€™s solution for feeless transactions.
- More Hive Power = more RC.
- Itâ€™s essential to manage RC carefully, especially as a new user.
