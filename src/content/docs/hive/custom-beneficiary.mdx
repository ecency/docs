title: Custom beneficiary

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Custom beneficiary allows community owners to set a default reward share for any post published in their community. This is a custom solution supported by Ecency and a few other frontends and is not enforced by the Hive blockchain.

Community owners can configure it when:

1. Creating a community on Ecency;
2. Updating community settings by the community owner (same as the Hive account named hive-xxxxxx).

Once enabled, posts published through Ecency or compatible frontends will automatically include the beneficiary and authors cannot remove it.

<Aside type="tip">
  To keep your community clean and popular be fair with your audience: do not
  set high beneficiary percentages. Ecency will warn users about communities
  with more than **25%** of rewards
