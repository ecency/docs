title: Community beneficiary
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Default beneficiary allows to community owners to set default reward for any posts which will be posted inside this community.

Community owners could setup it while:

1. Creating community on Ecency;
2. Updating community settings by community owner(same as community named Hive username â€“ hive-xxxxxx).

Any Ecency user which has set publishing to community with default beneficiary option never can unset it.

<Aside type="tip">
  To keep your community clean and popular be fair with your audience: do not
  set high value of beneficiares, Ecency will warn users about communities with
  more than **25%** of rewards
