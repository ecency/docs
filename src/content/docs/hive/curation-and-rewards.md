# Curation and Rewards on Hive

Hive is a blockchain that rewards both **content creators** and **curators** through a reward pool system. When you publish content or vote on quality posts, you can earn HIVE and HBD tokens.

---

## Content Rewards

Every post or comment published on Hive is eligible for rewards based on:

- Community votes (curation)
- Vote weight and Hive Power of voters
- Timing of votes (early curation vs late)

### Reward Breakdown

- **50% to the author** (in HBD and/or Hive Power)
- **50% to curators** (those who upvoted)

This split applies after the 7-day payout window ends.

## Curation Rewards

Curators are users who **vote** on content. You earn rewards if:

- You vote on **high-quality content**
- Your vote lands **early**
- Your **Hive Power** is significant

> Tip: Voting within the **24 hours window** after a post is published is often ideal for curation.

---

## Voting Power

Your ability to influence rewards depends on your **Hive Power**:

- More HP = bigger vote = more potential curation reward
- Voting uses **Voting Power**, which regenerates ~20% per day
- You can vote ~10 full votes per day at 100% strength

> Use vote sliders to manage your vote weight and avoid depleting power.

---

## Reward Payout Timeline

- A post remains active for **7 days**
- At the end of the window, rewards are calculated
- Payout is sent to the author and curators

---

## Reward Types

- **HBD** (Hive Backed Dollars) — stable value token
- **Hive Power** — staked influence (non-liquid)
- You can choose your preferred payout mode when posting

---

## Downvotes and Reward Redistribution

Hive also supports **downvotes**, which:

- Reduce the reward of low-quality/spam posts
- Return rewards to the general pool
- Cost a separate **downvote mana**, so they don’t harm normal voting capacity

---

## Summary

- Hive rewards authors AND curators
- Vote early on good content to earn curation rewards
- Use your Hive Power wisely and consistently
