# Curation and Rewards on Hive

Hive is a blockchain that rewards both **content creators** and **curators** through a reward pool system. When you publish content or vote on quality posts, you can earn HIVE and HBD tokens.

---

## Content Rewards

Every post or comment published on Hive is eligible for rewards based on:

- Community votes (curation)
- Vote weight and Hive Power of voters
- Timing of votes (early curation vs late)

### Reward Breakdown

- **50% to the author** (in HBD and/or Hive Power)
- **50% to curators** (those who upvoted)

This split applies after the 7-day payout window ends.

## Curation Rewards

Curators are users who **vote** on content. You earn rewards if:

- You vote on **high-quality content**
- Your vote lands **early**
- Your **Hive Power** is significant

> Tip: Voting within the **24 hours window** after a post is published is often ideal for curation.

### Understanding curation windows

- **First 24 hours (linear rewards):** Votes cast in the first day share rewards proportionally, so two voters who use the same voting strength during this period earn the same percentage return, regardless of who voted first.
- **24 to 72 hours (half weight):** Votes made after the first day but before 72 hours receive half the reward weight of a vote in the first window. Earlier voters keep their full share, so curators from the first window effectively gain a boost when later votes arrive.
- **After 72 hours (eighth weight):** Votes that land after the third day carry one-eighth of the first-window reward weight. They still earn curation, but the proportional payout is much smaller compared to voters who participated earlier.

If no one votes during the first 24 hours, then votes placed during the second window earn the same return they would have received in the first. The same principle applies if both the first and second windows are empty: third-window voters earn as if they voted in the earliest window.

## Voting Power

Your ability to influence rewards depends on your **Hive Power**:

- More HP = bigger vote = more potential curation reward
- Voting uses **Voting Power**, which regenerates ~20% per day
- You can vote ~10 full votes per day at 100% strength

> Use vote sliders to manage your vote weight and avoid depleting power.

## Reward Payout Timeline

- A post remains active for **7 days**
- At the end of the window, rewards are calculated
- Payout is sent to the author and curators

---

## Reward Types

- **HBD** (Hive Backed Dollars) — stable value token
- **Hive Power** — staked influence (non-liquid)
- You can choose your preferred payout mode when posting

### How curator rewards are split

- Each vote contributes **reward shares (rshares)** based on your Hive Power and vote weight.
- When the 7-day payout concludes, the curation portion of the reward pool is divided among all voters **proportionally to their rshares**.
- Earlier votes that accumulate rshares before large votes arrive tend to receive a bigger portion of the pool, because later votes are sharing the remaining pie.
- Example: If a post awards 10 HBD to curators and your vote represents 20% of the total rshares on that post, you would receive roughly 2 HBD.

## Downvotes and Reward Redistribution

Hive also supports **downvotes**, which:

- Reduce the reward of low-quality/spam posts
- Return rewards to the general pool
- Cost a separate **downvote mana**, so they don’t harm normal voting capacity

## Summary

- Hive rewards authors AND curators
- Vote early on good content to earn curation rewards
- Use your Hive Power wisely and consistently
