Ecency grows through community effort across our website, mobile apps, and backend services. Whether you are a developer, designer, translator, or passionate community member, there is a place for your skills.

### Documentation and code

2. Fork the relevant repository, clone it locally, and create a new branch for your work.
3. Update code, documentation, or translations as needed. For this documentation site, edit Markdown files under `src/content/docs/`.
4. Preview your changes locally (for example, with `yarn dev` for this site) to make sure everything looks and works as expected.
5. Commit your work and open a pull request. Our team and community review contributions regularly.
