# Account Recovery on Hive

Hive uses a robust key-based security system. If you lose access to your account or suspect a compromise, you may be able to recover it — **but only if your owner key or recovery account setup is intact**.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **Owner Key**: This is the master key for your Hive account. It can reset all other keys.
- **Recovery Account**: By default, the account that created yours becomes your recovery account (often `ecency`, `appreciator`, etc.)

---

## 🧭 1. Reset Keys Using Owner Key

If you still have your **owner key**:

1. Go to [Ecency Permissions page](https://ecency.com/@username/permissions)
2. Select **"Change Keys"**
3. Input your current owner key
4. Generate new posting, active, and memo keys
5. Broadcast the transaction

> ✅ This will restore control — make sure to back up your new keys.

---

## 🆘 2. Request Recovery from Recovery Account

If your account was **compromised** and the keys were changed:

1. Contact your **recovery account** (e.g. `ecency`) via email
2. We will verify ownership via email, social, or backup info
3. If successful, they initiate a recovery request
4. You confirm the request with your original owner key

> 💡 You have **30 days** after the keys were changed to initiate this process.

## 🙏 Final Advice

- Always back up your keys in **multiple safe places**
- Store your **owner key** offline
- Set a trusted **recovery account** proactively

Recovery is only possible if your owner key and recovery account setup are valid.
