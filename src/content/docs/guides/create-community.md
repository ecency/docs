# Create a Community

Communities bring people together around shared interests on the Hive blockchain. Follow these steps to create your own community using Ecency.

1. Sign in to [Ecency.com](https://ecency.com) with your Hive account.
2. Navigate to the [Communities](https://ecency.com/communities) page and click **Create community**.
3. Fill out the required details such as **name**, **description**, **avatar**, **banner**, and **community type**:
   - **Topic** – anyone can post or comment
   - **Journal** – guests can comment but only members can post
   - **Council** – only members can post or comment
4. Review the community settings and press **Create**. Creating a community burns a small fee (currently 3 HIVE).
5. A new account like `hive-123456` will be generated. You are its owner and can manage settings, moderators, and rules from the community page.

Your community is now live! Start posting, invite members, and grow conversations around your topic.
