# Delegating Hive Power (HP)

Hive Power (HP) is a staked form of HIVE. If you have extra HP, you can **delegate** it to another user. This gives them more **Resource Credits** and **voting influence**, without giving away your tokens.

Delegation is **reversible** and **does not transfer ownership**.

## ü§ù Why Delegate HP?

- Help **new users** who lack Resource Credits (RC)
- Support **projects or dApps**
- Enable **curation accounts** or **community bots**
- Temporarily lend influence without losing your stake

---

## üîß How Delegation Works

- Delegated HP gives RC and voting ability to the recipient
- Your HP remains yours, and you can undelegate at any time
- Undelegated HP returns after **5 days**
