## Downvote

Reporting the content or disagreeing with potential pending reward of particular post or post which is abusive or disrespectful towards others, you can downvote them. Downvoting is negative upvoting potentially removing some reward from author. Downvoting will also influence author's reputation and overall influence how much potentially content will earn. Here also Hive Power stake plays major role, if someone with more Hive Power upvotes while smaller stake downvotes, reputation and reward effects are less.
