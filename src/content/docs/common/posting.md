# Content quality and abuse guidance

Ecency is a place to share original ideas, stories, photos, videos, and art on the Hive blockchain. High-quality, well-tagged posts attract more readers and avoid downvotes or moderation.

## What is considered spam or abuse?

- **Plagiarism**: Copying text or media without crediting the source.
- **Repeated/identical comments** across multiple posts.
- **Tag misuse**: Using unrelated or misleading tags to gain visibility.
- **Threats or harassment** against other users.
- **Unlabeled NSFW**: Posting sensitive content without the `nsfw` tag.
- **Scams and fraudulent offers**.

Downvotes or moderation actions may follow these behaviors. Repeat offenders can damage their reputation score and be muted by communities.

---

## Publish with quality

- **Be original**: Add your own commentary, photos, or insights.
- **Cite sources**: Link to references when quoting or using others’ work.
- **Use relevant tags**: Pick 1–5 tags that match your topic (e.g., `travel`, `photography`, `introduction`). Keep them lowercase; hyphens are allowed.
- **Format for readability**: Use headings, lists, and images to break up text.
- **Set fair beneficiaries** if sharing rewards with collaborators.
- **Respect community rules**: Many communities have their own posting standards — read them before submitting.

## Safe tagging practices

- Choose tags that accurately describe the content so readers and curators can find it.
- Avoid trending tags unrelated to your post; mislabeling can lead to downvotes.
- Add `nsfw` for adult or graphic content to warn viewers.

---

## Commenting etiquette

- Add value with feedback or questions; avoid one-word replies.
- Do not paste the same link or promotion across many posts.
- If you spot abuse, downvote politely or report it in the relevant community rather than starting a flame war.

## Protect your reputation

- Your **reputation score** rises with constructive engagement and falls with abuse or downvotes.
- Consistent quality posting, thoughtful comments, and helpful curation are the best ways to grow reputation.
