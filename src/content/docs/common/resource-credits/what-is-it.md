title: What are Resource Credits?
---

Transacting on the Hive blockchain has zero fees, transaction rate-limiting is employed to safeguard the blockchain from spam attacks. Every action that you take on the blockchain will consume a small amount of Resource Credits. This includes posting, commenting, voting, transferring tokens, etc. Viewing content does not consume Resource Credits.

Every user has a limited amount of Resource Credits to use each week. The more transactions a user does, the less Resource Credits they will have left (until they recharge). Users with more HIVE POWER will have more Resource Credits.

If you run out of Resource Credits, you will be unable to transact with the blockchain until your Resource Credits recharge (happens automatically), you acquire additional HIVE POWER, **request Boost+** using Ecency Points, or purchase a **Boost (Account Boost)** in the mobile app to receive a temporary delegation.
