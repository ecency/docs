# Resource Credits troubleshooting

Resource Credits (RC) power every Hive transaction. When they run low, you may be unable to post, comment, or claim rewards. Use this guide to recover quickly.

---

## Check your RC status

1. Open your **profile → Wallet → RC** on Ecency.
2. Review **RC %** and the **estimated actions left** (posts, comments, transfers).
3. Check for **power-downs** or **large votes** that may have reduced your RC reserve.

---

## Fast ways to restore RC

- **Power up** even a small amount of HIVE to increase your RC pool immediately.
- Use **Boost+** (Ecency Points) to request a temporary HP delegation that increases RC.
- Ask a friend to temporarily **delegate Hive Power** to your account.
- Wait for natural regeneration: RC refills at roughly **20% per day**.

---

## Reduce RC usage

- Limit **edits** and large media uploads until RC recovers.
- Avoid posting multiple times in a short period; comment and vote more sparingly.
- Disable automatic posting features from third-party apps if they are draining RC.

## Estimate RC needs (typical ranges)

| Action | Approximate RC cost |
| --- | --- |
| Vote or small comment | Very low (a few RC) |
| New post with images | Moderate |
| Token transfer | Low to moderate |
| Power up/down | Low |

Values vary with network congestion and account HP. Always check the **estimated actions left** indicator in your wallet for a personalized view.

## When to contact support

- RC is stuck near zero for more than a day even after powering up.
- You see errors signing transactions despite having RC.
- You suspect unusual RC drain from a compromised key.
