### Why are there different keys?

There are different keys with the appropriate permissions for what you are doing.

Posting keys - this key should be used for social networking actions, like posting, commenting and voting. This key has a limited set of permissions and it is not able to be used for monetary actions. So you can't lose money if someone else gets access to this key.

Active key - this key has additional permissions for more sensitive monetary-related actions, like transferring and exchanging tokens. When performing a wallet related action, you may be prompted to authenticate with your Active key. You should only enter your Active Key into apps which you trust because anyone with access to this key can take your tokens. Do yourself a favor and store this key safely to avoid losing tokens in the future.

Owner key - is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account, including the owner key. Ideally it is meant to be stored offline, and only used to recover a compromised account.
