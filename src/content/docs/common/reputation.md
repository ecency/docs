Your reputation is an important indicator of your behavior and how the community perceives your work. When you join Hive, you begin with a reputation score of 25, which can change based on the number of upvotes you receive. The direction of this change is solely determined by your actions. By contributing high-quality content and engaging in meaningful discussions, you can increase your reputation and earn a good income. However, if your content involves abuse or plagiarism, receiving downvotes will inevitably lead to a decrease in your reputation.

## How to improve my Reputation score?

The more upvotes you receive from users with high reputation, the higher your reputation score will be. Earning upvotes by giving value to the community is the greatest approach to improving your reputation score.

## Why my Reputation score is going down?

Your reputation score is affected by the upvotes and downvotes you receive. If a user with a higher reputation downvotes you, it can decrease your reputation score. However, if you have more upvotes than downvotes (taking into account the weight of each vote), your reputation score will still increase overall.
