# New user onboarding checklist

Follow this checklist to set up your Hive identity, secure your keys, and start participating on Ecency in your first week.

---

## Day 0: Create and secure your account

- **Create an account** via [Ecency signup](https://ecency.com/signup?referral=ecency) or the [account creation guide](/guides/create-account/).
- Save your **owner**, **active**, **posting**, and **memo** keys in at least two offline places.
- Install **Hive Keychain** or the **Ecency mobile app** for safer logins.
- Note your **recovery account** (often `ecency` if created through Ecency) and how to contact them.

---

## Day 1–2: Learn how Ecency works

- Read [How Ecency works](/get-started/how-it-works/) and [What is Hive?](/hive/what-is-hive/).
- Review [keys and permissions](/common/keys/) so you know which key to use for each action.
- Set up **profile and avatar** so people recognize you.

---

## Day 2–3: Get posting-ready

- Draft your **introduction post** with relevant tags like `introduction`.
- Check **Resource Credits (RC)** in your wallet; if low, consider a small [power up](/guides/power-up-down/) or temporary [Boost+](/ecency/boost-and-promote/).
- Learn **posting etiquette** and anti-abuse rules in [content quality and abuse guidance](/common/posting/).

---

## Day 3–4: Engage and earn

- Publish your introduction post and **reply to comments**.
- Vote on posts to learn how **voting mana** regenerates (see [voting power](/common/resource-credits/voting-power/)).
- Join 2–3 **communities** relevant to your interests (see [Communities](/hive/communities/)).
- Explore **Ecency Points** and how to spend them for visibility in [Ecency Points](/ecency/ecency-points/) and [Boost/Promote](/ecency/boost-and-promote/).

---

## Day 4–5: Wallet basics

- Learn the differences between **HIVE**, **HBD**, and **Hive Power** in [Hive tokens](/common/hive-tokens/).
- Try a small **power up** or **transfer** to understand signing transactions.
- Review **savings** and **conversion** timelines in [payouts and conversions](/ecency/wallets/payouts-and-conversions/).

---

## Day 5–7: Mobile and cross-chain

- Install and sign in on the [Ecency mobile app](/guides/use-mobile-app/) to enable push notifications and quick posting.
- If you hold other assets, generate cross-chain addresses in the [Ecency Wallet](/ecency/wallets/about/) and review the [cross-chain quickstart](/ecency/wallets/cross-chain-wallets/).

---

## Ongoing habits

- Claim rewards weekly and consider **powering up** a portion for more RC and influence.
- Vote on **witnesses** and **DHF proposals** using the [governance participation guide](/hive/governance/).
- Back up your keys any time you rotate them, and bookmark the [account recovery playbook](/guides/recovery/).
- Stay connected via the [Ecency Help chat](https://ecency.com/chats/hive-125126/channel) for support and updates.
