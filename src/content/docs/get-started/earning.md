## When can I claim my rewards?

When the period is over, pending reward changes to actual reward and you are able to claim earned rewards. In your Wallet, click the Claim Rewards button to add the tokens to your account.

## What is curation reward?

Curators will have reward (Hive Power) from the post payout. As a result of the vote given by the curators, the post will have a certain amount of payout. The author and the curator(s) share the post payout in the ratio of 50:50. The post payout happens in 7 days. So at the end of the 7 days, the author's and curator's rewards are available for claim.
