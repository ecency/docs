# Cross-chain wallet quickstart

Ecency can generate lightweight, self-custodied wallets for **BTC**, **ETH**, **BNB**, **SOL**, **APT**, **TRX**, and **TON** so you can monitor and transfer multi-chain assets next to your Hive balances.

---

## Generate a cross-chain address

1. Open **Wallet → Tokens** in the Ecency web or mobile app.
2. Scroll to the **External chain tokens** section.
3. Select the chain (BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, APT, TRX, TON) and click **Generate address**.
4. Save the address and any displayed backup phrase if provided.
5. Send a small test amount before larger transfers.

> Addresses are created locally and associated with your Hive account for convenience, but you remain in control of the keys.

## Deposits and withdrawals

- **Deposits**: Send assets directly to the generated address. Confirm network fees and memo requirements (if any) for that chain.
- **Withdrawals**: Use the **Send/Transfer** action inside the token panel, confirm the destination address, and sign with the required key or device.
- **Fees**: Network fees vary by chain and are displayed before submitting the transaction.

## Security tips

- Back up any **seed phrases** or private keys shown when creating the wallet; Ecency does not keep a copy.
- Start with low-value test transfers, especially on faster chains like SOL or TRX.
- Avoid pasting addresses from untrusted sources; verify QR codes or manually check checksums.
- Keep your device updated and avoid transacting on public Wi‑Fi.

## When to use cross-chain wallets

- Consolidate **on-chain tips or payments** from other platforms without leaving Ecency.
- Track multiple chains while focusing on Hive content.
- Move value between chains before trading or staking elsewhere.

For full wallet capabilities (staking, swapping, hardware wallet support), you may still use dedicated wallets and then deposit or withdraw through Ecency-managed addresses.
