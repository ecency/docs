# Payouts and conversions troubleshooting

If rewards or conversions look stuck, use this guide to understand timelines and fix the most common issues.

---

## Reward payouts

- **Pending rewards**: Posts and comments pay out after **7 days**. The dollar amount is an estimate that can change with votes.
- **Split**: By default, rewards are **50% author / 50% curator**. Beneficiaries or declining rewards can change this.
- **Claiming**: After the 7-day window, rewards move to **Claimable**. Press **Claim Rewards** in your wallet to receive them.
- **Where they go**: Half of the payout is usually **HBD** (to liquid or savings) and half **Hive Power** unless you selected “100% HP”.

### Troubleshooting payouts

- **I don't see a Claim button**: Wait until the post is at least 7 days old and ensure you are signed in with the right account.
- **Claim failed**: Check you are signing with the **active** or **posting** key via Keychain or the mobile app and try again.
- **Rewards lower than expected**: Late downvotes or reduced post value will lower the payout; check the post history.
- **Power-down overlap**: Powering down does not block claims, but it can lower your RC; ensure you have enough RC to claim.

## Conversions between HIVE and HBD

- **HBD → HIVE**: Blockchain conversion takes about **3.5 days** (7,200 blocks). Once requested, it cannot be cancelled.
- **HIVE → HBD**: Instant if using the market order book; subject to available liquidity.
- **Fees**: No protocol fee, but price movement can affect the final amount.

### Troubleshooting conversions

- **Still pending after a day**: HBD→HIVE conversions always take 3.5 days; check the **Savings/Conversions** list for ETA.
- **Wrong amount received**: Market volatility can change the return; compare with the price feed at time of request.
- **Need it faster**: Use a market trade instead of a conversion if speed matters.
- **No balance change after request**: Refresh and confirm you initiated the conversion from the correct wallet (liquid vs savings).
