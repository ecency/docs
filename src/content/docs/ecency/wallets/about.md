# Ecency Wallet

Ecency includes a fully integrated wallet that lets you manage your **Hive account balances**, **transfers**, **layer-2 tokens**, and even **external chain assets** like **BTC**, **ETH**, **SOL**, **APT**, **TRX**, and **ATOM**, all in one place.

The wallet works across **web**, **mobile**, and **desktop** apps.

---

## Wallet Overview

The wallet provides access to:

- HIVE (liquid token)
- Hive Power (HP)
- Hive Backed Dollars (HBD)
- Savings balances
- Hive Engine layer 2 tokens
- SPK layer 2 tokens
- Ecency Points
- External chain tokens (BTC, ETH, SOL, APT, TRX, ATOM)

You can view balances, recent transactions, and perform key actions across these assets.

### External Chain Tokens

Ecency Wallets can generate lightweight wallets for supported blockchains such as **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **Ethereum (ETH)**, **Solana (SOL)**, **Aptos (APT)**, **Tron (TRX)**, and **Cosmos (ATOM)**. These direct integrations give you full control and self custody, letting you track and transfer cross-chain tokens alongside your Hive assets without leaving Ecency.

## Key Actions

### ✅ Power Up

Convert liquid HIVE into Hive Power (HP) to:

- Increase your voting power
- Gain Resource Credits (RC)
- Participate in governance

> Powering up helps you earn more curation rewards and influence.

---

### ✅ Power Down

Convert Hive Power back into liquid HIVE over a 13-week period (weekly payouts). Useful if you want to:

- Trade HIVE
- Transfer it to others
- Use it outside Hive ecosystem

> Be mindful — powering down reduces your voting and RC capacity.

---

### ✅ Transfer Tokens

Send HIVE or HBD to other users:

1. Tap “Transfer”
2. Enter recipient name, amount, and optional memo
3. Confirm with your active key

---

### ✅ Convert HBD ↔ HIVE

On Ecency Web, you can request conversions between:

- HBD → HIVE (via 3.5-day conversion process or instantly via market)
- HIVE → HBD (instantly via market, if liquidity is available)

---

### ✅ Use Savings

Move HIVE or HBD into **savings** for extra security.

Withdrawals from savings take **3 days** to complete. 
Transferring HBD into savings earns you 15-20% (subject to governance settings) annual rewards claimable monthly.
