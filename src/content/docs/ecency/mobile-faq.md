# Ecency mobile app FAQ

Answers to the most common questions about installing, signing in, and using Ecency on mobile.

---

## How do I install the app?

- **Android**: [Play Store](https://android.ecency.com)
- **iOS**: [App Store](https://ios.ecency.com)
- You can also download releases from [GitHub](https://github.com/ecency/ecency-mobile/releases).

---

## What sign-in options are available?

- Hive username + **posting/active key**
- **Hive Keychain mobile** (preferred for security)
- **Hivesigner**
- **Hiveauth** where supported

> The **owner key** should never be used to log in.

---

## How do push notifications work?

- Enable notifications when prompted at first launch or from **Settings → Notifications**.
- You can toggle categories such as new replies, mentions, payouts, and boosts.
- If they stop working, re-open the app while connected, and ensure battery optimizations are disabled for Ecency.

---

## What if I don't have enough Resource Credits on mobile?

- Request a small **Boost+** from **Perks** using Ecency Points to get temporary HP and RC.
- **Power up** a small amount of HIVE if available.
- Reduce RC usage by avoiding repeated edits or large uploads until RC regenerates (about 20% per day).

---

## What is the difference between Boost+, Boost, and Promote on mobile?

- **Boost+**: Uses Points to request HP delegations and may improve curation and RC.
- **Boost (Account Boost)**: Mobile-only **in-app purchase** that grants a 30-day HP delegation without using Points.
- **Promote**: Uses Points to list a post in the promoted feed; no votes guaranteed.

See the [Boost and Promote guide](/ecency/boost-and-promote/) for a detailed comparison.

---

## Where can I find drafts and bookmarks?

- Tap your **profile → Drafts/Bookmarks** to edit saved drafts or revisit saved posts.
- Drafts created offline will sync when you reconnect.

---

## How do I switch accounts?

1. Open the **menu**.
2. Tap **Switch → Accounts**.
3. Add another Hive account and pick which one to use.

Multiple accounts stay saved; no need to log out.

---

## How can I report a bug or get support?

- From the app: **Menu → Help**.
- Ask in the [Ecency Help chat](https://ecency.com/chats/hive-125126/channel) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ecency/ecency-mobile/issues).
