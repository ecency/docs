# Boost and Promote on Ecency

Ecency offers tools like **Boost+**, **Boost (Account Boost)**, and **Promote** that help increase visibility of your Hive posts. These tools are powered by Ecency Points or mobile in-app purchases and are available to all users on the Ecency platform.

---

## What is Boost+?

**Boost+** uses your Ecency Points to support your account with potential **delegations** from Ecency accounts and partner delegators.

### Key Features:
- May receive **delegations** on your account.
- Great for **content curation** and **organic reach**.
- Consumes more points than Promote.

### How to Use Boost+:
1. Go to Perks or profile page on Ecency, click the **“Boost+”** button.
2. Choose the number of points to use.
3. Confirm and wait for delegations to arrive over the next few hours.

> 💡 Boost+ doesn't guarantee votes, but higher boosts often get you more curation rewards and reward others. It also gives you more Resource Credits.
>
> ⚠️ Don't confuse Boost+ with **Boost (Account Boost)**, a separate mobile-only feature purchased via in-app stores and not tied to Ecency Points.

## Boost (Account Boost)

**Boost**, also called **Account Boost**, is available only through the Ecency mobile app as an **in-app purchase**. It grants your account a temporary **Hive Power delegation for 30 days** and doesn't consume Ecency Points.

### Key Features:
- Provides **HP delegation** for 30 days.
- Purchased via **in-app purchase** in the mobile app.
- Does **not** require Ecency Points.

### How to Use Boost:
1. Open the Ecency mobile app and go to **Perks** or your **wallet**.
2. Select **Boost** and complete the in-app purchase.
3. Delegation arrives almost instantly and expires after 30 days.

## What is Promote?

**Promote** adds your post to a **promoted section** on Ecency’s web and mobile apps. This increases **visibility**, but does **not involve voting**.

### Key Features:
- Advertises your post in a visible spot.
- Costs fewer points than Boost.
- No curation rewards involved.

### How to Use Promote:
1. After publishing, click the **“Promote”** button.
2. Select the number of points.
