# Boost and Promote on Ecency

Ecency offers two unique tools — **Boost** and **Promote** — that help increase visibility of your Hive posts. These tools are powered by Ecency Points and are available to all users on the Ecency platform.

### Key Features:
- May receive **delegations** on your account.
- Great for **content curation** and **organic reach**.

2. Choose the number of points to use.
3. Confirm and wait for delegations to arrive over the next few hours.

> 💡 Boosting doesn't guarantee votes, but higher boosts often get you more curation rewards and reward others It also gives you more Resource Credits.

## What is Promote?

**Promote** adds your post to a **promoted section** on Ecency’s web and mobile apps. This increases **visibility**, but does **not involve voting**.

### Key Features:
- Advertises your post in a visible spot.
