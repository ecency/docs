title: What are Waves?
---

Waves are Ecency's home for short-form content. They let you share brief updates, images, or links without writing a full post, making it easy to microblog on Hive.

## Other short-form content on Hive

Different communities have their own names for quick posts:

- **Threads** – bite-sized discussions in the LeoFinance community.
- **Snaps** – short content from the Peakd team and community.
- **Moments** – photo updates from the Liketu community.
- **Buzz** – micro posts on D.Buzz.

Waves brings these styles together so you can explore and interact with short content from across Hive in one place.
