# Ecency vs Other Hive Frontends

Hive has a rich ecosystem of frontends ‚Äî apps and websites that let you interact with the blockchain. Ecency is one of the most feature-rich and modern options available, but it‚Äôs helpful to understand how it compares to others.

## What is a Frontend?

A **frontend** is an interface that connects to Hive‚Äôs decentralized backend. It allows users to:

- Read and post content
- Vote, comment, and follow
- Manage their Hive account
- Interact with communities

Each frontend uses the same Hive blockchain data ‚Äî but presents it differently.
