Ecency wallets replaces the older Ecency SDK experience and focuses purely on
wallet-related operations across the Ecency website and mobile app. The new
`@ecency/wallets` package gives us a single, dedicated layer for creating and
managing wallets while keeping the rest of the Ecency stack lightweight.

## Standard seed phrase, multi-chain addresses

We utilize a blockchain-standard seed phrase to derive wallet addresses across
different blockchains. A single mnemonic can be used to:

1. Generate addresses for multiple supported chains without asking the user to
   juggle several keys.
2. Keep derivation compatible with common wallet tooling, so the same seed can
   be recovered in other BIP39-style wallets.
3. Sync addresses between web and mobile clients while still letting each
   client enforce its own encryption and secure storage policies.

<Aside type="note">
  The seed phrase never leaves the client. When a wallet needs to be backed up
  or restored, the mnemonic is provided by the user, and derived addresses are
  synced to Ecency services only after local encryption is applied.
</Aside>

## What `@ecency/wallets` handles

`@ecency/wallets` is scoped to wallet functionality so the rest of the Ecency
codebase can stay focused on social and content features. The package is
responsible for:

- Generating or importing the mnemonic that seeds all derived addresses.
- Deriving per-chain addresses from the same seed phrase, so Ecency can surface
  balances and transactions for multiple blockchains.
- Publishing public wallet metadata to Ecency services when users choose to
  make their addresses available.

## Example: derive addresses from a mnemonic

The snippet below shows the general flow for creating a mnemonic and deriving a
set of addresses. The exact API surface may evolve, but the key steps—create or
import a seed, derive addresses for requested chains, and persist only the
public details—remain the same.

export const exampleCode = `
import { createWalletClient } from '@ecency/wallets';

// Create a client for wallet-only operations in web or mobile apps
const walletClient = createWalletClient();

// Either generate or import a mnemonic
const mnemonic = await walletClient.createMnemonic();

// Derive addresses for the chains you need to display in Ecency
const addresses = await walletClient.deriveAddresses({
  mnemonic,
  chains: ['hive', 'bitcoin', 'ethereum'],
});

// Store only public addresses with Ecency services; keep the mnemonic local
await walletClient.publishPublicWallets({ addresses });
`;
export const fileName = "wallets.ts";
