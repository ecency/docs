Any user in a Ecency system can create/import external tokens to account. It helps different clients and Ecency to operate with these tokens, show overview or detailed view etc.

### Storage

Each token's public information is storing in two places:

1. **Private Ecency API** – uses for Ecency only purposes, strong-safe place;
2. **Profile metadata** – can be used in any Hive client, weak-safe place, could be overrided by any client.

### Create a wallet

To create a wallet SDK provides mutations and automatically set it to query. No need to handle it automatically.

export const exampleCode = `
import { useWalletCreate, EcencyWalletCurrency } from '@ecency/sdk';

const username = 'demo.com';
const currency = EcencyWalletCurrency.BTC;

const { mutateAsync: createWallet } = useWalletCreate(username, currency);

// Wallets contains all wallets in a Record<EcencyWalletCurrency, {...}> format
const { data: wallets } = useQuery({ queryKey: ["ecency-wallets", "wallets", username] })
`;
export const fileName = "create-wallet.ts";

<Code code={exampleCode} lang="ts" title={fileName} />

<Aside type="caution">
  Created wallets exists only in current session. Wallets haven't published
  anywhere on this step. Saving to private API or metadata are different
  mutations.
