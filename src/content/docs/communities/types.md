title: Community Types
---

All communities and posts are viewable and readable by all, and there is a governance mechanism which can affect visibility and prioritization of content for the purpose of decreasing noise and increasing positive interactions (however a community wishes to define it) and discourse. By default, communities are open for all to post and comment ("topics"). However, an organization may create a restricted community ("journal") for official updates: only members of the organization would be able to post updates, but anyone can comment. Alternatively, a professional group or local community ("council") may choose to limit all posting and commenting to approved members (perhaps those they verify independently).

- 🌍 Topic: anyone can post or comment
- 📰 Journal: guests can comment but not post. only members can post.
